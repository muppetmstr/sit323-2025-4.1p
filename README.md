This is a simple nodejs app that completes the 4 basic mathematic functions.  Addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

Depending on what endpoint is used, the app will do one of the 4 functions.  Included is a catch if you attempt to divide by zero.  You can use the API endpoints add, subtract, multiple and divide, followed by two values and the app will show the result.  You use a GET request to manage all of these.
